        <h2>Appams are tasty, lacy and fluffy hoppers from the Kerala cuisine made with fermented rice and coconut batter.</h2>
        <p>Thin and crispy around the edges with soft fluffy centers, appams taste delicious when paired with mutton stew for a hearty breakfast. They also just so happen to be gluten-free and vegan.</p>
