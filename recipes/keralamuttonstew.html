        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a pressure cooker. Add cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and fry for a minute.</li>
            <li>Slit green chillies. Thinly slice the onions. Add onion, green chilli, curry leaves and salt. Saute it until onion is soft and translucent. Don't let it brown.</li>
            <li>Crush/grind ginger and garlic. Fry it well for couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the spice powders - freshly crushed whole pepper, pepper powder, fennel powder and coriander powder. Fry the spice powders for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Clean the mutton pieces and drain the water. Add mutton, 1/4 cup water, salt and mix it well. Pressure cook for around four whistles or until meat is cooked. Don't overcook. Mutton has lot of fat and it would be melted by this time.</li>
            <li>Either use the same cooker or transfer the above mutton with gravy to another pan for the rest of the preparation. Add medium thick coconut milk. Adjust salt and pepper. Let it cook for 5 minutes. Then add thick coconut milk. Mix it well.</li>
            <li>Add coriander leaves. Bring it to boil and then switch off. Coriander leaves is optional.</li>
            <li>Garnish - Chop shallots. In a small pan, add 2 teaspoons oil. Fry shallots. Keep it aside. Fry cashewnut and raisins in the same pan one after the other. Add the garnish to the stew. </li>
